For now its just technological demo of two features:
real time initial body problem solution for drawing planet orbits from initial state
real time GPU texturing

Everything in this simulation is physics driven, bodies have real mass, velocity etc.


Zoom out using mouse wheel, you should see randomly generated star system with planets, moons orbits and red indicators from gravity source to bodies
System is generated in real scale so you need to zoom in to see actual bodies.
Move using wsad

For now its just a lot of code splitted across multiple files, roots for further expansion.
